# Message.ly

Message.ly is a user-to-user private messaging app.

This exercise is meant to teach and reinforce useful common patterns around authentication and authorization.

Step 0: Setup

    Install requirements, and make Git repo.
    Create messagely database and import schema from data.sql

Step 1: Take a Tour

Many parts of this exercise are already given to you, and shouldn’t need to change:

    app.js
        Pulls in user routes, messages routes, and auth routes

    expressError.js
        Handle errors in express more gracefully

    db.js
        Sets up messagely database

    server.js
        Starts server on 3000

    config.js

    This may be a new file for us. As you build the app (and, in particular, the further study), you may add to it.

    Its job is to be a centralized place for constants needed in different places in the application. Other places should require() in these values.

    In order to make it easier to keep secret things secret, it also will try to read a file named .env. This is a traditional name for a file containing “environmental variables needed for an application”.

    If you create a file like this:
    .env

    SECRET_KEY = abc123

    This config.js file will read and use it.

    middleware/auth.js

    Useful middleware for “is a user logged in?” and “is the logged-in user the same as the :username provided in a route?”

    Look carefully at this code — it may be slightly different than other versions you’ve seen. Make sure you understand what it is doing!

Step 2: Fix the user model

We’ve provided a module file for the User class:
models/user.js

```
/** User class for message.ly */

/** User of the site. */

class User {

  /** register new user -- returns
   *    {username, password, first_name, last_name, phone}
   */

  static async register({username, password, first_name, last_name, phone}) { }

  /** Authenticate: is this username/password valid? Returns boolean. */

  static async authenticate(username, password) { }

  /** Update last_login_at for user */

  static async updateLoginTimestamp(username) { }

  /** All: basic info on all users:
   * [{username, first_name, last_name, phone}, ...] */

  static async all() { }

  /** Get: get user by username
   *
   * returns {username,
   *          first_name,
   *          last_name,
   *          phone,
   *          join_at,
   *          last_login_at } */

  static async get(username) { }

  /** Return messages from this user.
   *
   * [{id, to_user, body, sent_at, read_at}]
   *
   * where to_user is
   *   {username, first_name, last_name, phone}
   */

  static async messagesFrom(username) { }

  /** Return messages to this user.
   *
   * [{id, from_user, body, sent_at, read_at}]
   *
   * where from_user is
   *   {username, first_name, last_name, phone}
   */

  static async messagesTo(username) { }
}


module.exports = User;
```

Fill in the method bodies.

Make sure you read the docstrings carefully so your functions return the right output. Also, any method that tries to act on a particular user (like the .get() method) should throw an error if the user cannot be found.

If you get stuck, note that the Message class has been completed for you. You can look to the methods there for some inspiration or assistance with some of the more complex queries.

Once you have finished, you can run the tests we’ve provided for the User and Message models (make sure to create and seed the messagely_test database first!):

```
$ jest -i
```

Step 3: Fix the routes

We’ve provided stub files and docstrings from the routes.
routes/auth.js

```
/** POST /login - login: {username, password} => {token}
 *
 * Make sure to update their last-login!
 *
 **/


/** POST /register - register user: registers, logs in, and returns token.
 *
 * {username, password, first_name, last_name, phone} => {token}.
 *
 *  Make sure to update their last-login!
 */

routes/users.js

/** GET / - get list of users.
 *
 * => {users: [{username, first_name, last_name, phone}, ...]}
 *
 **/


/** GET /:username - get detail of users.
 *
 * => {user: {username, first_name, last_name, phone, join_at, last_login_at}}
 *
 **/


/** GET /:username/to - get messages to user
 *
 * => {messages: [{id,
 *                 body,
 *                 sent_at,
 *                 read_at,
 *                 from_user: {username, first_name, last_name, phone}}, ...]}
 *
 **/


/** GET /:username/from - get messages from user
 *
 * => {messages: [{id,
 *                 body,
 *                 sent_at,
 *                 read_at,
 *                 to_user: {username, first_name, last_name, phone}}, ...]}
 *
 **/

routes/messages.js

/** GET /:id - get detail of message.
 *
 * => {message: {id,
 *               body,
 *               sent_at,
 *               read_at,
 *               from_user: {username, first_name, last_name, phone},
 *               to_user: {username, first_name, last_name, phone}}
 *
 * Make sure that the currently-logged-in users is either the to or from user.
 *
 **/


/** POST / - post message.
 *
 * {to_username, body} =>
 *   {message: {id, from_username, to_username, body, sent_at}}
 *
 **/


/** POST/:id/read - mark message as read:
 *
 *  => {message: {id, read_at}}
 *
 * Make sure that the only the intended recipient can mark as read.
 *
 **/
```

In order, implement these routes. Make sure to check security appropriately:

    anyone can login or register
    any logged-in user can see the list of users
    only that user can view their get-user-detail route, or their from-messages or to-messages routes.
    only the sender or recipient of a message can view the message-detail route
    only the recipient of a message can mark it as read
    any logged in user can send a message to any other user
